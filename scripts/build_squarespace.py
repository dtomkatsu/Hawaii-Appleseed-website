Build paste-ready Squarespace Code Block files, one per page, into
squarespace-ready/.

Two kinds of pages:

1. Marker pages — the standalone HTML already contains a
   `BEGIN ha-xxx` … `END ha-xxx` block authored for injection. We just
   slice that block out (dropping the preview-only <html>/<head>/nav
   chrome) and write it to its own file.

2. Homepage (index.html) — never had injection markers. It was built as
   a full standalone page with global CSS resets and a fixed-nav chrome.
   We assemble a scoped injection: fonts + the head <style> (with the 6
   global rules scoped to #ha-home-embed so they can't leak into the
   Squarespace template) + the content sections (hero…get-involved,
   dropping announce/nav/footer) + the behaviour scripts (the two chrome
   scripts are null-guarded, so they no-op harmlessly).

# Relative asset paths (assets/…) resolve against the Squarespace page URL
# once pasted, so images 404. Rewrite them to absolute URLs on the GitHub
# Pages host, which serves the same asset tree. NOTE: this hotlinks assets

# Squarespace and swap these URLs so the site doesn't depend on Pages.

# The issue pages carry fixed-position scroll enhancements — a scroll
# progress bar and a sticky pill/tab nav pinned at top:107px (below the
# GitHub site's fixed nav). position:fixed can't anchor to the viewport
# inside a code block (transformed section wrappers capture it, and there
# is no fixed site nav at 107px). Rebuild the nav as position:sticky
# (code-block-safe) anchored at top:0, collapsing to 0 height until its
# reveal-on-scroll class fires so it leaves no gap in the flow. The thin
# scroll-progress line has no sticky equivalent, so it stays hidden. Class
# names exist only on the issue pages, so this is a no-op elsewhere.
# How the sticky rebuild works (verified in-browser):
#   1. The page roots use overflow-x:hidden, which forces overflow-y:auto —
#      a scroll container that traps position:sticky (it anchors to the root
#      instead of the viewport and never engages). overflow:clip clips the
#      same way WITHOUT creating a scroll container.
#   2. The bar becomes position:sticky top:0 (its markup is already the
#      first child of the page-root section, so it can stick for the whole
#      page).
#   3. A tiny script gives the bar a negative bottom margin equal to its
#      height, so it occupies ZERO net flow space — while hidden (opacity 0,
#      the original reveal state) it overlays the hero top with no gap, and
#      the page's existing IntersectionObserver reveal keeps working as
#      designed. ResizeObserver keeps the margin in sync when pills wrap.
# The thin scroll-progress line has no sticky equivalent and stays hidden.

def build_ufsm(lines):
    """ufsm/index.html is a standalone page under ufsm/ — not marker-based,
    and normally served on its own via GitHub Pages (see PAGES_SUBSITES).
    It predates the .ha-xxx namespacing convention (global :root/*/body/
    h1-h4 selectors), so scope it under #ha-ufsm-embed with
    scope_css_selectors(), the same recipe as build_homepage()/build_support().

    Two UFSM-specific fixes on top of the standard scoping:

    1. .ufsm-pdf-fab is position:fixed, which can't anchor to the viewport
       inside a Squarespace Code Block (same root cause as
       STICKY_BAR_OVERRIDE above). Override it to position:sticky as a
       DIRECT child of #ha-ufsm-embed (so its sticky containing block spans
       the whole embedded page, keeping it pinned through the full scroll),
       right-aligned via margin-left:auto instead of right:18px. This
       reserves ~50px of one-time flow height at the very top of the
       content instead of floating from pixel zero — a minor visual
       tradeoff for something that actually works in a code block.

    2. ufsm/index.html's PDF-export script toggles the .ufsm-pdf-capture
       class directly ON its capture root (#ha-ufsm-embed when present,
       document.body in the standalone deploy — see its `captureRoot`
       variable), not on some deeper element. scope_css_selectors() would
       otherwise turn `.ufsm-pdf-capture X` into the DESCENDANT selector
       `#ha-ufsm-embed .ufsm-pdf-capture X`, which can never match (the
       class lands ON #ha-ufsm-embed itself, not a descendant of it). Pre-
       rewrite those rules to the compound form
       `#ha-ufsm-embed.ufsm-pdf-capture X` before scoping runs;
       scope_css_selectors() treats anything already starting with the
       wrapper id as pre-scoped and leaves it alone.
